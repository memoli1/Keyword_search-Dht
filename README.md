Simulate search through a set of keywords

Compile all files and run service.java

The application initially creates a network of distributed hashes; it is asked to insert objects into it.

A typical example of insertion: “insert,Something,302.” To end the insertion, type “stop.”

Next, a hypercube is created to index the information and optimize the search. The hypercube and the Dht do not yet have a real connection, the mapping between the keyword set and the nodes responsible for the object is missing.
